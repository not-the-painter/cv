    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Born and raised in Montreal, I spent the better part of my twenties trying
      to become a rock star. When I finally realized that wasn't going to work
      out the way I had planned I went back to school to study math and physics
      so I could play with all the techy things that had fascinated me since I
      was a child. I'm now lucky enough to be doing just that. Life is good but
      short, may as well enjoy the journey.
